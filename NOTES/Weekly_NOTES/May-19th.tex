\subsection{Formation of learning}
\textbf{Target}: for the samples from unknown process $P(Z)$, we have got some samples $D=\{z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, ... z_{n}\}$, now that we want to find this process $P(Z)$.\newline

\noindent \textbf{Method}: here we could first assume an loss function $L$, that takes parameters of \textbf{decision function} and \textbf{these samples $z_{i}$}, the decision function is what we assumed before like linear function or quadratic function, samples are the sets $D$. By minimizing the loss function $L(f, D)$, we can get the unknown variables $A, B...$ in the loss function and get its exact representation.\newline

\noindent \textbf{Result}: the loss function $L$ is just our assumed process $P(Z)$, we can assume many loss function and find the best one among them.
