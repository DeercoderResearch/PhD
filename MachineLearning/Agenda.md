## Brief Description

This documment serves as my learning/research plan for exploring the world of **Machine Learning**.

We have other similar plan like **Data Science**, which may include some topics including the reading of book as well as the practicing code like:

        * <Data science from scratch>(OReily)

        * <Doing Data Science>(OReily)


## Plan

Sept.2015           Theano



## Reference

Many of the concepts and plan for study comes from the rss source of 爱可可's weibo, and it also comes from my paper review, since the paper that I read has some implementation, but many of them requires much knowledge like theano, convNets etc...

So it's essential to get a basic idea of them, and mastering the programming skills of them would be a plus for researching, finding a job and experimenting our hyposis as well.
